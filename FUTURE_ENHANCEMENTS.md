# Future Enhancements for Personal Finance Tracker

This document outlines potential improvements and feature additions for the Personal Finance Tracker application. These enhancements are organized by priority and complexity.

## Immediate Next Steps (Based on Code Review)

These items address issues or incomplete features identified in the current codebase and should be prioritized:

1.  **Complete Budget Goal Saving:**
    *   Implement the logic in `SettingsService` to save/load budget goal data (amount and date).
    *   Update `SettingsPanel`'s `setBudgetGoal` method to call the service.
    *   Consider using the `Budget.java` model if appropriate.
    *   *Files*: `SettingsService.java`, `SettingsPanel.java`, `Settings.java`, `Budget.java` (optional)

2.  **Implement Graphical Charts:**
    *   Utilize the `JFreeChart` library (already in `pom.xml`) in `AnalysisPanel` to display a proper pie chart for expense distribution instead of the current text/asterisk representation.
    *   *Files*: `AnalysisPanel.java`

3.  **Implement CSV Import Logic:**
    *   Implement the `CsvDataService` class to handle CSV parsing using `commons-csv`.
    *   Replace the placeholder logic in `TransactionService.importFromCsv` with calls to `CsvDataService` to parse the selected file based on user input from `ImportCsvDialog`.
    *   *Files*: `CsvDataService.java`, `TransactionService.java`, `ImportCsvDialog.java`

4.  **Refine AI Assistant:**
    *   Enhance the `AiAssistantService` beyond basic responses. Consider integrating a real AI model API or implementing more sophisticated local analysis algorithms based on transaction history.
    *   *Files*: `AiAssistantService.java`

5.  **Model Usage:**
    *   Review and potentially utilize the `Category.java` and `Budget.java` model classes where appropriate (e.g., use `Budget` for budget goals, potentially refactor category strings to use `Category` objects).
    *   *Files*: `Settings.java`, `Transaction.java`, `SettingsPanel.java`, `TransactionPanel.java`, `AnalysisPanel.java`, relevant Service classes.
